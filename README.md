# Reasoning Model Evaluations

This website compiles available evidence on how reasoning models (e.g., o1) compare to previous models. The evidence is organized by domain and includes both improvements and areas without significant progress. Each entry includes links to sources and detailed findings.

We try to keep the evidence up to date, but it is not always possible to do so. 

If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact us.
